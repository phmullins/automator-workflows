## Automator Workflows
Nothing more than a small collection of Apple macOS automator workflows that I have created over the years. Make sure to check out the usage information if you plan on using any of these.

## Workflows
- [Terminal](https://github.com/phmullins/Automator/tree/master/net.pmullins.terminal.automator) - Opens a Terminal window based on the current Finder location. 
- [Resize](https://github.com/phmullins/Automator/tree/master/net.pmullins.resizer.automator) - Resizes larger images down to 1024x768 for use on social media sites.
