## Automator Workflows
Nothing more than a small collection of Apple macOS automator workflows that I have created over the years. Make sure to check out the usage/installation information if you plan on using any of these.

## Workflows
- [Netdrive](https://github.com/phmullins/Automator/tree/master/net.pmullins.netdrive.automator) - Mounts pre-configured network drives.
- [Resize](https://github.com/phmullins/Automator/tree/master/net.pmullins.resizer.automator) - Resizes larger images down to 1024x768 for use on social media sites.
- [Terminal](https://github.com/phmullins/Automator/tree/master/net.pmullins.terminal.automator) - Opens a Terminal window based on the current Finder location.
